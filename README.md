# discord-music-bot
My own discord music bot name after the 4 time WDC using python and for my own discord channel using !'command'

Features:

Music on Demand: Play single songs or full playlists directly from YouTube.

Local File Playback: Upload your own .mp3 or .wav files for the bot to play.

Full Music Controls: Includes a robust queue system, song looping, skipping (to the next song or a specific track), pausing, and resuming.

F1 Race Schedule: Get the official schedule for the next F1 race, complete with circuit information and a live countdown to lights out.

Coinflip Minigame: Bet with a fake currency called "MV" in a high-stakes coinflip game. Claim your daily MV and see who comes out on top.

Authentic Personality: All bot responses are designed to sound just like Max on the team radio—direct, confident, and simply lovely.
